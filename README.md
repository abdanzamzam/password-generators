# Password Generators
Password Generators is an npm package for Node.js that allows users to easily generate random and secure passwords. With the help of this package, developers can create algorithms that produce strong and complex passwords for various applications and services that require enhanced security.

## Key Features
1. Generate random passwords with customizable lengths.
2. Support for setting security criteria to ensure strong passwords.
3. Option to generate passwords with only alphanumeric characters or include special characters.
4. Avoidance of ambiguous characters, making it easier for users to enter passwords on different devices.
5. Eliminate potential character repetitions to increase password uniqueness.
6. Integratable with various web applications and services for security purposes, such as account registration and user authentication.
